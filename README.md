# KeplerGl_LAB
This is an assignment done for my master's for the module **Big Data Analytics Technologies**. The purpose is to build a geo visualization script using [KeplerGl](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/blob/master/docs/keplergl-jupyter/user-guide.md)

## Introduction
### Kepler 
kepler.gl for Jupyter is an excellent tool for big Geospatial data visualisation. Combine world-class visualisation tool, easy to use User interface (UI), and flexibility of python and Jupyter notebook.
kepler.gl is a web-based visualisation tool for large Geospatial datasets built on top of deck.gl. Uber made it an open-source last year, and its functionality is impressive. You can easily drag and drop your dataset and tweak it immediately on the web to visualise large scale geospatial datasets with ease
